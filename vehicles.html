  <h2 id="planes">Planes &amp; Jets</h2>
  <p>Planes and jets rely on lift from wings and tailfins and thrust from engines or thrusters. To build a stable aircraft, ensure the centre of lift sits just behind the centre of mass, align thrust with the centre of mass and use control surfaces for pitch, yaw and roll.</p>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with a light frame for the fuselage using frame blocks.</li>
    <li>Add wings and tailfins from the lift and drag category to generate lift.</li>
    <li>Mount engines or thrusters aligned with the fuselage to provide forward thrust.</li>
    <li>Use control surfaces (e.g. hinges or servos connected to small fins) for pitch and roll control.</li>
    <li>Adjust weight distribution and wing positions until the plane is stable.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="cars">Cars</h2>
  <p>Cars are ground vehicles that rely on wheels for movement. Build a sturdy chassis, add an engine and ensure proper steering and suspension.</p>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a rectangular frame to serve as the chassis.</li>
    <li>Attach wheels; use steering hinges on the front wheels for turning.</li>
    <li>Place an engine block or thrusters to drive the rear wheels or all wheels as needed.</li>
    <li>Add suspension blocks for smoother handling on rough terrain.</li>
    <li>Test and adjust the weight distribution to keep the car stable and prevent flipping.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="mechs">Mechs</h2>
  <p>Mechs are walking machines that require mechanical blocks like hinges, servos and pistons to simulate legs. Balance and control are critical.</p>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Design a sturdy torso using frame blocks.</li>
    <li>Use pairs of hinges and servos to create articulated legs.</li>
    <li>Add pistons or servos for knee and ankle movement.</li>
    <li>Balance the weight so the mech can stand without tipping over.</li>
    <li>Use logic blocks to coordinate leg movement for walking.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="weapons">Weapon Vehicles</h2>
  <p>Weapon vehicles are equipped with cannons, rockets or other weapon blocks. They require stability and proper aiming mechanisms.</p>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Construct a stable platform or vehicle chassis using frame and balance blocks.</li>
    <li>Mount weapon blocks securely, ensuring they have a clear line of fire.</li>
    <li>Use mechanical blocks like hinges or servos to allow the weapons to aim.</li>
    <li>Install engines or thrusters to move the vehicle into position.</li>
    <li>Add logic blocks to control firing and aiming if necessary.</li>
  </ol>
